For Linux, you would just need to run this on the commands window:

For 64-bits Firefox:
sudo sh -c 'echo "override chrome://global/skin/scrollbars.css scrollbars.css" > /usr/lib64/firefox/chrome.manifest'

For 32-bits Firefox:
sudo sh -c 'echo "override chrome://global/skin/scrollbars.css scrollbars.css" > /usr/lib/firefox/chrome.manifest'

(If you want a more automated way, you can always make an executable file with "chmod +x /your-route-goes-here/patch.sh" typing the codes of the patch inside the "patch.sh" file)

The installation directory path may vary depending on the distribution if you use a package manager to install the 
application from their repository, so change if necessary.
