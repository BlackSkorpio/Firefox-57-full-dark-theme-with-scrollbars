If using for the first time, make sure that the "scrollbars.css" file is in the same folder as the .bat files, and then apply the "First time patch".
After this, you should apply the re-patcher after each firefox update (No need to have scrollbars.css in the same folder for that).

- Use Scrollbars re-patcher (32-bits) if you have a 64-bits Windows and you are using a 32-bits Firefox.

- Use Scrollbars re-patcher (64-bits) if you have a 32-bits Windows, or a 64-bits Windows and you are using a 64-bits Firefox.

If you have a program files (x86) on your C: drive, you have a 64-bits Windows.

If for some reason you installed firefox in some other drive other than C:, you will have to update the .bat files installation paths yourself (using notepad or any other code editor).
