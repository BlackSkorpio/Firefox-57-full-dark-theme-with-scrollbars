For Linux, you would just need to run these on the commands window, depending on your firefox version:

For 64-bits Firefox:
sudo mv ./scrollbars.css /usr/lib64/firefox-57.0
sudo sh -c 'echo "override chrome://global/skin/scrollbars.css scrollbars.css" > /usr/lib64/firefox-57.0/chrome.manifest'

For 32-bits Firefox:
sudo mv ./scrollbars.css /usr/lib/firefox-57.0
sudo sh -c 'echo "override chrome://global/skin/scrollbars.css scrollbars.css" > /usr/lib/firefox-57.0/chrome.manifest'

^ In any of the above you will have to change the firefox version path depending on the version you have currently installed. 
(If you had Firefox 58.0, then "mv ./scrollbars.css /usr/lib/firefox-58.0", as well as for the chrome.manifest line)
