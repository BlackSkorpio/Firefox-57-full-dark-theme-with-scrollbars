For Linux, you would just need to run this on the commands window:

For 64-bits Firefox:
sudo sh -c 'echo "override chrome://global/skin/scrollbars.css scrollbars.css" > /usr/lib64/firefox-57.0/chrome.manifest'

For 32-bits Firefox:
sudo sh -c 'echo "override chrome://global/skin/scrollbars.css scrollbars.css" > /usr/lib/firefox-57.0/chrome.manifest'

You will have to change the firefox version path to the new one in each update ^
(As you can tell, I can't make an universal shell script to re-patch for this reason)

The installation directory path may vary depending on the distribution if you use a package manager to install the 
application from their repository, so change if necessary.
